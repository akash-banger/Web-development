// npm stands for => Node Package Manager

// use "npm init" command to make a directory as a npm Package

//  if the version is something like 'a.b.c'
// then here a => major version
// b => minor version
// c => batch > bug fixes

// lets talk about nodemon ==>  its used to automatically update the terminal during any change in our file just like liveshare 
// to install nodemon ==> "npm install nodemon --global"  >> (to install in a particular package) ==> "npm install nodemon --save-dev"(will save as devDependencies)

console.log("this is it");
// now it will automatically refresh using nodemon

// someversions shits
