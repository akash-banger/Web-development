<!--Async and defer both instruct the browser to download the script in a separete thread, while the rest of the page (the dom, etc,) is downloading, so the page loading is not bloacked by the scripts.

if your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies, than use async.

if yout scripts need to wait for the parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the dom being i  place , load tham using defer and put their corresponding <script> elements in the order you want your browser to execute them.-->
